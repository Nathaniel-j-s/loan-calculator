# loan-calculator
24 hour project, originally made as part of a job application, but I thought it made for a fun challenge.

I was limited to only using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery for this project (I double checked. They wouldn't let me use Angular, or even Bootstrap, which made me sad).

I'm not proud of the file structure. Two HTML files, two CSS files, and two JavaScript files all in the same folder. Not my best work as far as that's concerned.

However, the functionality of it is pretty much as perfect as it can get for a test like this. I had to refresh myself on how to use localStorage, which was fun, and the rest was a cakewalk. You'll have to clone/download the repository and open up pageone.html in order to see the whole thing in action (again, file structure), but play around with it, take a look at my notes in the code itself, and let me know what you'd have done to make it better! Or, make your own! Give yourself 24 hours to make a similar little website and show it off to me!
